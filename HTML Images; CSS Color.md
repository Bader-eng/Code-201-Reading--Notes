# Image:
1. addIng Image:
* <img> :To add an image into the page you need to use an <img>element.
* src :This tells the browser where it can find the image file.
* alt :This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it
* title :You can also use the titleattribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image
2. height & Width of Images:
* height :This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
* width :This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
3. Where to place Images In Your Code:
* before a paragraph :The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
*  InsIde the start of a paragraph :The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
*  In the middle of a paragraph :The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.
4. old Code: aligning Images horizontally:

5. three rules for CreatIng Images:
1. save i  mages in the right format
2. save i  mages at the right size
3. use the Correct resolutIon

6. Image resolutIon:
Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file

# Color :
## Foreground Color :
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values :These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. hex Codes :These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. Color names :There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

## Background Color:
you can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names 

## Understanding Color:
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker
1. RGB Values :values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. 
2. Hex Codes : Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
3. Color Name : Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
4. saturation Ratio : Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, 
there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.
# Css3 :
1. opacity : the opacityproperty which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
2. rgba : property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity.
3. Hue : Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color,
although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
4. Saturation: is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
5. hsl:
The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. 
The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for:
hue,saturation,lightness,alpha.

# Text:
1. font-family:The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.
2. font-size:
* Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px

* percentage:The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px
* ems:An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m
2. bold:font-weight:
* normal:This causes text to appear at a normal weight.
* bold:This causes text to appear bold.
3. font-style:
* normal
* italic
* oblique
4. text-transform:
* uppercase
* lowercase
* capitalize
