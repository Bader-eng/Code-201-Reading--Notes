## INTRODUCTION:
### how PeopLe access the web:
1. **Browsers**: People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox,
Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

2. **Web servers**: When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet 
to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.
Some big companies run their own web servers, but it is more common to use the services 
of a web hosting c'ompany who charge a fee to host your site.

3. **Screen readers**: are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. 
 They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.
 
## how websites are created:
Small websites are often written just using HTML and CSS.Larger websites — in particular those that are updated regularly and use a content management system (CMS), 
blogging tools, or e-commerce software — often make use of more complex technologies on the web server

## how the web works:
1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site.
2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books;
 they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.
3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. 
A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.
4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

1. **Tags**: act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags 
3. **Attributes**: provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts:
 a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
4. **<body>**:Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
5. **<head>**:This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). 
 6. **<title>** :The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually
  type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page
