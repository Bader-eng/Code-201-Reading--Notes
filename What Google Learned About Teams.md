* So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join. A classmate mentioned that some students were putting together 
teams for ‘‘case competitions,’’ contests in which participants proposed solutions to real-world business problems that were
evaluated by judges, who awarded trophies and cash. The competitions were voluntary, but the work wasn’t all that different from 
what Rozovsky did with her study group: conducting lots of research and financial analyses, writing reports and giving presentations. 
The members of her case-competition team had a variety of professional experiences: Army officer, researcher at a think tank, director of 
a health-education nonprofit organization and consultant to a refugee program. Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, everyone 
clicked. They emailed one another dumb jokes and usually spent the first 10 minutes of each meeting chatting. When it came time to brainstorm, 
‘‘we had lots of crazy ideas,’’ Rozovsky said.
* It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who 
 were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm.
 It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun 
and easygoing. In some ways, the team’s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.

In late 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Google’s 51,000 employees. 
By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years. They hadn’t yet figured out how to 
make psychological safety easy, but they hoped that publicizing their research within Google would prompt employees to come up with some ideas of their own.
