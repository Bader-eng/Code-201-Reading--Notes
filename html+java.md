# list :
 HTML provides us with three different types:
 1. Ordered lists● are lists where each item in the list is numbered
 2. Unordered lists● are lists that begin with a bullet point 
 3. Definition lists● are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms
 4. You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sub-list or nested list

 # Box Dimensions :
 1. width,height :
 By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

 2. min-width, max-width: Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.
 3. overflow : 
  * hidden:This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
  * scroll :This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
  4. ## border-style :
  * solid: a single solid line
  * dotted: a series of square dots
  * dashed :a series of short lines
  * double :two solid lines (the value of the border-widthproperty creates the sum of the two lines)
  * groove : appears to be carved into the page
  * ridge : appears to stick out from the page
  * inset:  appears embedded into the page
  * hidden / none: no border is shown
 5.  padding :The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.
 6. margin:The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems
# A switch statement:
 A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
