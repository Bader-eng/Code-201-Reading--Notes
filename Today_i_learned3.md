# How to pair:

1. The Driver is the person at the wheel, i.e. the keyboard. She is focussed on completing the tiny goal at hand, ignoring larger issues for the moment

2. The Navigator is in the observer position, while the driver is typing. She reviews the code on-the-go, gives directions and shares thoughts

### Driver:
  -Write the code according to the navigator's specification
  -Listen intently to the navigators instructions
  -Ask questions wherever there is a lack of clarity
  -Offer alternative solutions if you disagree with the navigator
  -Where there is disagreement, defer to the navigator. If their idea fails, get to failure quickly and move on
  -Make sure code is clean

### Navigator:
  -Dictates the code that is to be written - the 'what'
  -Clearly communicates what code to write
  -Explains 'why' they have chosen the particular solution to this problem
  -Check for syntax / type errors as the Driver drives
  -Be the safety net for the driver
  -Make sure that the driver sticks to the small task at hand
