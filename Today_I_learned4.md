## Functions:
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

1. To create a function we can use a function declaration.
function showMessage() {
  alert( 'Hello everyone!' );
}

## Branch:
* "branching" lets you make changes to an object without directly affecting the original object until you are ready to "merge" those changes back in.

* Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches
