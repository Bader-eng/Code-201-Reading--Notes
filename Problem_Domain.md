## WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 
* Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. 
# JavaScript:
 *  Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or Boolean. 
 * Arrays have a name and a group of values. ( Each item in an array is a name/value pair because it has an index number and a value.) â€¢ Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called.
 *  Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs (but the names are referred to as keys). 
 ## The Document Object Model (DOM) :
 * specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is  in the browser window. 
 ## ACCESSING ELEMENTS :
 1. getElementByld(id)
 2. querySelector(css selector') 
 3. getElementsByClassName(class)
 4. getElementsByTagName(tagName)
 5. querySelectorAll (css selector) 

 ## DOM QUERIES :
 you can see four different DOM queries that all return a Nodelist. For each query, you can see the elements and their index numbers in the Nodelist that is returned. 
 1. getElementsByTagName('hl')
 2. getElementsByTagName('li ')
 3. getElementsByClassName('hot')
 4. querySe l ectorA 11 ( ' li[id] ' )
